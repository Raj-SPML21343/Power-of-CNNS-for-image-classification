In the realm of Advanced Image Processing, this assignment explores the potency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. CNNs prove superior to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in capturing intricate image features. The project's focus is on classifying the MNIST Dataset using both DNNs and CNNs. Remarkably, even with a low number of parameters, the CNN outshines the DNN, achieving significantly higher accuracy.
